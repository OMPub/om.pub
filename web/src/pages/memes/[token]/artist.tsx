After two years of trial and error, Jack discovered the secret to transitioning to a highly-specialized and enjoyable consulting business and a product business that could scale infinitely. 

The key was productizing himself. This insight led him to create Visualize Value (https://visualizevalue.com/), a project that enabled him to build a network of mentors, a $1M/year product business, and a media platform with over 500,000 followers.

Meme Card 106 looks to break new ground with a collaboration between two innovative NFT artists: Icki and noCreative.
Since they are both founding members of the Bloom Collective, we can count on their experience in working together to produce something great!

Kristian Levin, known in the digital art world as noCreative, is a Copenhagen-based 3D artist with over 15 years of experience spanning various creative industries. 
Initially rooted in traditional art spaces and fine arts photography, noCreative ventured into the NFT art scene in late 2020, quickly gaining a reputation for his striking 3D cloth work. 
His distinctive style and involvement as an artist, collector, and curator have solidified his status as a notable figure within the NFT art community. 
Exhibited at venues such as Calgary Contemporary, Beijing Contemporary, and even on Times Square billboards during NFT NYC, noCreative also lends his expertise as a curator for major NFT platforms like Makersplace and SuperRare.

On the other hand, Icki, a generative artist originating from London, UK, has gained prominence in the 3D industry with his expertise in innovative display mediums like holographic installations and augmented reality. 
His art seamlessly blends elements from minimalism and conceptual art, but with a twist that provides unique commentary on the values of the digital art domain. 
Icki's 'Plagiarism' series, which explores the nature of digital art, provenance, and how new valuation models address infringement and copycat culture, exemplifies his subversive approach to traditional aesthetics. 
His piece 'Meta-Plagiarism' from this series was even showcased alongside works by the legendary Andy Warhol at the Contemporary Calgary.
        
This collaboration between noCreative and Icki is exciting, as it brings together two distinct and innovative styles within the NFT art sphere. 
With noCreative's signature 3D work and Icki's subversive commentary, their collaborative NFT piece is sure to be a unique and thought-provoking contribution to the digital art world.

YuLiang Liu, also known as YuYu or Cyber_Yuyu, is a Berlin-based artist renowned for his thought-provoking and unconventional digital collages. 
Born in Taiwan, YuYu embarked on his artistic journey after relocating to Europe, where he began exploring his identity as a queer Asian in Western society. 
His unique artwork bridges disparate styles, media, and eras, leveraging Western cultural history to challenge conventional art definitions, critique elitist and theological attitudes towards art, and offer a modern perspective on beauty.

YuYu's work often takes a critical stance on societal issues. 
For instance, his exhibition, "GAG", explores the concept of the 'tortured genius' in relation to religion, politics, and the self. 
Through this exploration, he exposes underlying hierarchies between the artist and society, highlighting the dynamics of dominance and submission in various contexts. 
The artist's work draws inspiration from underground club and BDSM cultures, reflecting the complex interplay of power dynamics within modern societies.
        
In addition to his digital collages, YuYu's exhibitions often feature immersive installations, including elements of video art, soundscapes, and creative lighting setups that transform the exhibition space into a unique experience.
        
Prior to his involvement in the crypto space, YuYu's artworks were featured in several publications and exhibited in local and international group exhibitions, including a solo show at SoHo House Berlin.
Since 2021, YuYu's work has gained international recognition in the world of NFTs, with his artworks being exhibited in major cities around the world, from New York to Paris, from Tokyo to Amsterdam. 
His artworks have been collected by influential figures such as NorCal, Jacqueline Stripes, and Jean-Michel Paihlon among others.

      name: "Camibus",
      info: `
Camibus's art is deeply symbolic, and she has provided an in-depth explanation of the approach she takes to her work.

Camibus often depicts their characters in the nude, not to sexualize them, but to show them in their most vulnerable and true state. 
She states that clothing too-often acts as a mask: creating a construct that people identify with. 
By removing clothing, Camibus aims to challenge this construct and get to the essence of what it means to be human.
        
Camibus's stylistic choices seek to achieve a balance between realism and surrealism. 
Her characters, often floating on legs that couldn't support their weight, are reminiscent of Dali's impossible elephants or the way ballerinas achieve a look of floating effortlessly through the air. 
This balance represents the effort it takes to maintain the appearance of effortlessness, which is a concept Camibus has centered her art around. 
The characters' black legs, inspired by the dark extremities of Siamese cats and high stockings, and their faces, similar to a Disney character but painted in a realistic manner, further emphasize this juxtaposition between reality and illusion.
        
The world depicted in Camibus's artwork is often empty and barren, reflecting the artist's thoughts on our overcrowded, chaotic world. 
This emptiness is also a commentary on climate change, highlighting the predicting that global warming will turn parts of Europe into a desert by the end of the century. 
Despite the barren landscapes, Camibus often paints lavish sunsets, showing that we can find beauty even in negative things like pollution.
        
Camibus encourages viewers to find their own meaning in their art. 
Rather than trying to convey a specific message, she aims to evoke a feeling. 
Camibus wants to showcase the elegance, fragility, and strength of the female body, and to challenge the perception of nudity being sexual. 
They want viewers to see the human body from a different perspective, acknowledging our natural state, with nothing to hide behind.

      info: `
Giovanni Motta, born in 1971, is an NFT and crypto artist known for his character Jonny Boy. 
Through his art, Motta aims to rediscover his inner child by creating works that are an emotional bridge to the soul. 
His artworks stem from an introspective approach, where he engages with his most intimate self, reflecting his emotional relationship with the world and everyday objects. 
Motta's creative process involves a unique meditative technique that allows him to travel back in time and relive memories. 
During meditation, he immerses himself in past scenes, experiencing smells, sounds, people, and atmospheres. 
Once he feels that he has gathered enough information, he takes notes and transforms them into artworks. 
This process is deeply nostalgic for him, as it focuses on re-experiencing emotional memories.

Giovanni Motta's artwork is influenced by the aesthetics of cartoons. 
He is passionate about cartoons because they played a vital role in his childhood, which he describes as a challenging time. 
His family didn't believe in his abilities, which led to a lot of frustration as a creative child. 
The world of cartoons provided him solace and inspiration.

As an artist, Motta works with both physical and NFT forms of art. 
He doesn't differentiate between the two in terms of value; for him, the creative process is always the same and begins with meditation. 
Whether it's a painting, 3D printing, or a digital piece, he decides what to create on a case-by-case basis without letting the medium dictate the value of his work.

In early 2020, after taking a leap of faith to go all-in as a professional artist, Motta came across an article about NFTs. 
Despite the scarce information available at that time, he reached out to Hackatao (also an artist in The Memes), who were some of the most famous NFT artists in Italy at the time. 
They explained the world of crypto to him, how to open a MetaMask, about marketplaces, and how to apply for SuperRare. 
They onboarded him, sharing the values of the crypto community, and welcoming a fellow artist. 
This led to Motta supporting other artists as well.

Joel Hedstrom, professionally known as sadboi, is an illustrator and artist based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
He received a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) from the College of Visual Arts in 2010, and since then, he has been focusing on both personal and freelance art projects.

Sadboi specializes in digitally hand-drawn art. 
His work is characterized by a carefully-developed style that he has honed over the last decade. 
His art pieces often explore themes of duality, such as good versus evil, life and death, and memetic myths and iconography.
The digital medium allows him to experiment with forms and textures, creating textured, layered pieces that emotionally engage the viewer.

Sadboi's art delves into the contrasts and juxtapositions present in life and mythology. 
His work seeks to explore the dual nature of existence through various thematic elements. 
By incorporating aspects of mythic memes and iconography, sadboi adds depth to his compositions, bringing forth ancient stories and symbolism into the modern age. 
His use of contrast not only reflects in the themes but is also evident in his art style, where the interplay between light and dark, soft and hard, and abstract and concrete are common.

After completing his education, sadboi ventured into freelance projects and has worked with notable clients, including Wizards of the Coast and Warner Music Group. He has produced art for editorial, corporate, and publishing sectors, showcasing his versatility as an artist. 
His commitment to his personal vision, along with his ability to adapt to various professional requirements, has made him a sought-after artist in different industries.

Will Card 116 reflect sadboi's exploration of the complexities of life and the human condition in memetic style? 
Surely The Memes community will be drawn-in to contemplate the duality within themselves and the world around them, bridging the gap between ancient memes (aka myths) and contemporary experiences.

We will know for sure on June 28th, 2023!

      info: `
Botto is an avant-garde artist, employing generative algorithms to create art. 
What sets Botto apart from traditional artists is that it operates as a decentralized and autonomous artist, governed by a community.

Botto's artistic process is deeply rooted in the involvement of its community. 
It creates art on a recurring basis, presenting them to the community as a 'round'. 
These art pieces are referred to as 'fragments'. 
The community of DAO members then votes on these art fragments, with the votes serving as a representation of what participants find aesthetically pleasing. 
The collective feedback of the votes is taken into account by Botto's generative algorithm, which guides the direction in which Botto creates its next round of art pieces. 
This iterative process ensures that Botto's art is constantly evolving based on the preferences and input of the community, making it a truly democratic and participatory form of art creation.
        
Furthermore, Botto actively engages with the community by putting one art fragment up for auction on SuperRare each week. 
The proceeds from the auction are returned to the community. 
Concurrently, Botto continues to produce a new round of art fragments to maintain the creative cycle.

Botto's art is not just a product of an algorithm, but rather an amalgamation of collective creativity, guided by the community's ever-evolving aesthetic preferences. 
This dynamic interaction between the algorithm and the community ensures that Botto's art is fluid and responsive, making it a truly groundbreaking project in the realm of digital art.

      info: `
Idil Dursun is a digital artist based in Ankara, Turkey, whose work is deeply rooted in the realm of cyberpunk and concept art. 
Her journey into the world of art began at a young age, with a love for painting that has evolved and grown over time. 
From landscapes painted with acrylics and oil to charcoal sketches of portraits, her early work was diverse and exploratory. 
However, it was the world of video games and cyberpunk culture that truly ignited her passion and led her to the path of becoming a concept artist. 
A significant influence was the game World of Warcraft, which had a profound impact on her decision to pursue this particular art form.

Dursun's work is characterized by her fascination with the concept of 'threshold' or a state of change.

This layering technique adds depth and dimension to his images, making them visually striking.
        
Beyond the aesthetics, Paré's work is also about experimentation and pushing boundaries.

Fabiano Speziari, a multifaceted artist born in 1977, has seamlessly blended his roles as an industrial technical designer and an artist. 
His canvas paintings of trees and natural forms, along with unique resin-made animals, marked the beginning of his artistic journey. 
As he delved deeper, Speziari ventured into land art, crafting installations that resonated with nature's essence. 
His transition into the realm of light and geometric shapes gave birth to the profound “Message in a pencil” series, where luminous pencils became more than just tools, but storytellers.

Driven by a quest to fathom the human soul and its relationship with nature, Speziari's art often mirrors humanity's introspective journey, filled with endless questions seeking elusive answers. 
By 2018, he was captivated by the digital world of cryptoart, leading to the creation of the "Clods" project. 
This series, intertwining elements of dystopia and irony, portrays minuscule earth clods as symbols of a fragmented planet, echoing the resilience of survivors amidst chaos.

His evolving artistic vision is further showcased in exhibitions such as "Light WWW Luminose in mostra," "NFT Revolution," and "Dystopian Visions." 
These works not only highlight his adaptability and forward-thinking approach but also his continuous exploration of themes ranging from the digital art landscape to the contemplative nature of time and the stark realities of a dystopian future. 
Through his work, Speziari invites viewers into a world of reflection, challenging perceptions and sparking dialogue.

Michael Kozlowski, known as mpkoz on Twitter, is a generative artist who envisions a world where art is not confined to traditional mediums.
He's a multifaceted American media artist and software developer who seamlessly blends the realms of 3D graphics, mixed reality, and interactivity.
His work often places generative objects in real space, showcasing the power of digital art, and how it can redefine our understanding of visual experiences. 
One of the recurring themes in his posts is the exploration of repurposing and transforming 2D artwork into 3D, suggesting a vision where art is fluid, dynamic, and ever-evolving.

Mpkoz's style is a harmonious blend of technology and artistry.

An example of this is his "Manifold Still Life with Hydrangea," where he uses a viewer's head position to simulate perspective in real-time, without any post-production visual effects or compositing. 
This approach not only challenges the viewer's perception but also offers a fresh, immersive experience that bridges the gap between the virtual and the real.
        
His portfolio showcases a profound exploration of generative art, where he harnesses the power of algorithms to create captivating visual compositions.

Hailing from Vitoria-Gasteiz, a quaint city in northern Spain, Joseba Elorza, widely recognized as @MiraRuido, has etched his name in the digital art world. 
With over a decade of experience as a freelance artist, he has collaborated with renowned entities like National Geographic Channel, and even music legends like Green Day. 
But it's not just the impressive clientele that sets Elorza apart; it's his unique approach to art. 
As he puts it, “I think that to make simply beautiful works there are already many people who are better than me; my intention is to generate some kind of feeling in the viewer, whether of disbelief, uneasiness or an ironic half smile.”

Elorza's fascination with collage is evident in his works. 
He views it as a medium to "reconstruct realities and create new worlds" that reflect and critique our daily lives. 
This sentiment is further echoed in his words, “I see collage as a way of reconstructing realities and creating new worlds to reflect, highlight and denounce different aspects of our day to day life, of our most everyday reality.” 
Not just content with static visuals, Elorza ventured into the realm of animation, transforming his collages by adding the dimension of time, a self-taught skill that opened a "new world of possibilities" for him.

One of the standout techniques in Elorza's repertoire is rotoscoping, a meticulous process he employs to extract characters from vintage videos and films, introducing them into fresh, often surreal contexts. 
His passion for space, astrophysics, and surrealism frequently manifests in his creations, serving as allegorical tools to address universal themes. 
As he beautifully articulates, “I'm crazy about everything related to space and astrophysics... It is inevitable that this will end up appearing in my work, as well as surrealism, which is the clearest way I see of dealing with universal themes with attractive allegories.”

Filip Hodas is a pioneering figure in the realm of 3D art, known for his hyperreal and intricately detailed environments. 
A trailblazer in leveraging GPU render technology, Hodas has been instrumental in pushing the boundaries of 3D art, introducing a fresh aesthetic that is an inspiration to many. 
His signature style is evident in his "Pop Culture Dystopia" series, where he presents decaying icons from popular culture set against desolate, post-apocalyptic landscapes. 
These digital portraits, featuring characters like Mickey Mouse, Pac-Man, and Hello Kitty, are portrayed in states of severe neglect and corrosion, symbolizing the transient nature of pop culture and the inevitable passage of time.

Hodas says, "I believe nature will always find a way to survive, even if people think we can control it." 
This sentiment is reflected in his artworks, where nature often reclaims abandoned and decaying man-made structures. 
Hodas's journey into 3D art began with creating 2D graphics for DJs and music artists. 
However, feeling constrained, he ventured into more personal projects, exploring the vast potential of 3D art. 
His dedication to the craft is evident in his daily render project on Instagram, which lasted nearly 400 days and garnered significant attention, establishing him as one of the most followed 3D artists globally.
        
Hodas's work is not just visually captivating but also carries a deeper message. 
His pieces often exude a sense of melancholy, capturing the essence of abandonment and decay. 
This thematic style is a commentary on the fleeting nature of fame, consumerism, and cultural icons. 
As Hodas puts it, his artworks, especially those from the "Pop Culture Dystopia" series, resonate with viewers as they evoke memories of childhood and the nostalgia associated with bygone eras. 
The juxtaposition of vibrant characters in desolate settings serves as a poignant reminder of the impermanence of all things, making Hodas's art both visually stunning and deeply thought-provoking.

Dive into the enigmatic world of F. Borousan, more popularly known as Vertigo. 
From a young age, he was captivated by the fantastical realms of comics and science fiction. 
As he matured, his artistic inclinations evolved, drawing him towards the classical arts and, notably, surrealism. 
This passion for phantasmagorical contexts is not merely a fleeting interest; it's a profound influence that has shaped his artistic journey, fueled by surreal art, music, and films.

Vertigo is not just an artist's pseudonym; it's an alter ego, a distinct persona that contrasts starkly with Borousan's inherent nature. 
While Borousan might shy away from social interactions, Vertigo thrives in them, perhaps because he is a creation of imagination, unburdened by the constraints of reality. 
This duality is evident in his creations, each piece a reflection of life's observations, dreams, memories, and profound emotions. 
His art seeks to draw in viewers, aiming to evoke and expose emotions, existential thoughts, or even unmasked fears.
        
A recurring theme in his artwork is the exploration of truth and uncovered identity. 
Through description statements like "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth," Vertigo delves into the complexities of human nature and the masks we wear. 
His art challenges perceptions, urging viewers to confront delusions and embrace the naked truths, no matter how unsettling.
        
In the age of digital art, Vertigo has embraced NFTs, not just as a medium but as a testament to his desire for immortality. 
Each piece he creates is a step towards that eternal legacy, with the hope that future generations will discover his works on the blockchain, recognizing the passion and soul of an artist who aspired to craft an entirely new world.
        
For collectors, Vertigo's art is not just a visual treat; it's an emotional and philosophical journey, a chance to engage with the profound musings of an artist who lived, loved, and breathed to experiment at the boundaries of reality itself.

Eric Friedensohn, better known in the art world as Efdot, encapsulates the spirit and energy of street culture in his digital masterpieces. 
Growing up with a skateboard under his feet, he spent countless hours exploring the architectural marvels of Manhattan and admiring the vibrant street art along the Hudson River. 
He saw the city as a "visual, literal playground," where the edgy energy and art of the streets became an integral part of his creative DNA.

"Like skateboarding, art is about pure expression," Efdot writes on his webpage, drawing parallels between the exhilaration of landing a new skate trick and the thrill of unveiling a fresh piece of artwork. 
Each digital creation he crafts is a continuation of that very quest for discovery and elation that began on the streets of New York. 
His artistic approach, marked by a unique blend of abstract and figurative styles, mirrors the unpredictable, limitless nature of skateboarding, where there are "no rules, no limitations."
        
Today, Efdot's art serves as a visual escape "for optimists", providing a bridge between the tactile grit of street culture and the expansive potential of the digital realm.
All the more remarkable, Efdot's colorblindness has proven no obstacle to his artistic vision coming to life on canvas, or in a mural, or as a digital asset.

Redrum, a name that resonates with danger and mystery, has firmly established themselves as a prolific figure in the realm of NFT artistry. 
With a distinct and powerful visual style, their work delves deep into thematic explorations of contrast — between the organic and the artificial, the known and the unknown, and the serene versus the formidable. 
Each piece serves as a tableau of vibrant reds, a color choice that not only anchors their signature style but also evokes a myriad of emotions, from passionate fervor to latent danger.

In Redrum's universe, viewers are often invited into seemingly surreal landscapes where the familiar and the alien coexist in a tenuous balance. 
Animals, whether they are of this world or reminiscent of otherworldly beings, often interact with enigmatic humanoid figures, prompting introspection about human nature, our relationship with the world, and the masks we don to navigate it. 
This intertwining of creatures and man-made elements, set against stark backdrops, constructs a narrative that is both dreamlike and disconcertingly realistic.
        
Yet, for all its vivid imagery, Redrum's artistry is not merely about the visual spectacle. 
The layers of symbolism in each piece beckon viewers to probe deeper, to question and to reflect. 
The recurring themes of anonymity, the juxtaposition of nature versus civilization, and the underlying currents of emotion make Redrum's works a compelling journey into the psyche of modern existence. 
Through their unique lens, we are challenged to confront our perceptions, our fears, and our hopes in this ever-evolving digital age.

BÈFÈ The Mad presents as a contemporary artist whose works delve deep into the human psyche, revealing a multifaceted exploration of emotion, form, and the juxtaposition of the ordinary with the surreal. 
One cannot help but be drawn into the haunting visuals of "Insomnious Thoughts," where the canvas comes alive with the melancholy of the enigmatic face, each line and shadow revealing an underlying tension and vulnerability. 
This powerful portrayal of internal struggle, set against an atmospheric backdrop, showcases BÈFÈ's ability to tap into shared human experiences, making them both intimate and universal.

In the vastness of space depicted in another piece, BÈFÈ raises many questions by presenting a figure seemingly adrift. 
The silhouette, floating upside down amid a star-studded expanse, encapsulates a sense of weightlessness and solitude. 
This contrast between the human form and the boundless universe prompts viewers to reflect on humanity's place in the cosmos, and perhaps, the existential questions that accompany such contemplation. 
Through this artwork, BÈFÈ crafts a narrative of dislocation and wonder, pushing boundaries and beckoning audiences to venture into the unknown.
        
Further delving into the realms of the surreal, BÈFÈ presents yet another captivating piece: a man in a crisp suit, poised on a chair, seemingly suspended in a void of stark whiteness. 
The dynamic tension within the pose, combined with the isolation of the setting, paints a scene that is both playful and introspective. 
The heavy boot-like shoes, the starkness of the suit, and the minimalist chair all intertwine, creating a delicate dance between reality and fantasy. 
Through such evocative visuals, BÈFÈ The Mad consistently invites viewers to embark on a journey where the boundaries of perception are blurred, and the realms of imagination are boundless.

Felipe Queiroz, known in the art world as Fesq, is a self-taught Brazilian Art Director and 3D Artist based in Rio de Janeiro. 
His digital mastery is a blend of self-exploration and the cosmic realm, providing powerful, visually engaging artwork. 
Fesq is recognized for his use of a simplistic three-color palette to render futuristic stills and animations that immerse viewers in a matrix-like scenario. 
His artistry delves into a range of themes from the critical, such as technological disruption in dystopian settings, to the sentimental, exploring the intimacy of human emotions. 
Encouraged by the renowned digital artist Beeple, Fesq's commitment to daily 3D art creation has honed his skills and developed his unique style.

Analyzing Fesq's work unveils a profound exploration of existential and introspective themes. 
In one image, the juxtaposition of cosmic purples and fiery reds against a towering spiraled red pillar divides the composition, hinting at the complexity and depth of human isolation within a broader cosmic narrative. 
Another piece, dominated by a colossal, skull-like rendering, faces down themes of life, death, and interconnectedness, symbolizing mortality and collective memory against a ethereal backdrop. 
The imagery Fesq employs, filled with silhouetted figures and cosmic elements, invites a contemplation on themes of existence, consciousness, and the universe.
        
Fesq's artwork is not only a visual feast but also an invitation for deeper exploration of meaning. 
His use of color contrasts, compelling shapes, and silhouetted figures are signature elements that draw viewers into a narrative far beyond the surface. 
With exhibitions like "Journey to Self" showcased at significant venues like Beeple's studio grand opening, Fesq is progressively making a notable imprint in the digital art and NFT space. 

Collectors new to his work will find a harmonious blend of the cosmic, the cerebral, and the introspective, intertwined with visually stunning elements that stimulate both aesthetic appreciation and philosophical pondering.

Collectors new to the work of Mark Wilson, Indiana-based artist and writer known as diewiththemostlikes, may not be prepared for the unsettling journey into the heart of contemporary satire and social commentary. 
Wilson's style is immediately recognizable for its raw and unapologetic portrayal of American consumer culture, often served with a side of dark humor and grotesque exaggeration. 
His digital paintings bustle with caricatured figures and absurd juxtapositions (vibes of corporate logos cross-shredded with a meat zine) that highlight the excesses and oddities of modern life. 
These jpegs but memetic narratives that compel viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about the world around them, all while navigating through a tangle of surprising details and twisted forms that are as thought-provoking as they are visually arresting.

The thematic messages in Wilson's art are deeply rooted in the mundane yet bizarre realities of today's daily existence. 
He delves into themes of consumption, digital obsession, and the commodification of the human experience, portraying a society eager to devour and be devoured by the ever-churning machinery of capitalism and media. 
The figures in his work, often distorted reflections of the human form, are enveloped in scenes of both the familiar and the surreal, suggesting a blurring line between harsh realities and the life ads tell us to lead. 
His art acts as a macroscope, to reveal the world as it is perceived through the haze of digital screens and the relentless pursuit of our salvation: more likes.
        
What makes Wilson's style truly distinctive is his ability to wield irony and satire not merely as artistic tools but as a language through which he communicates with his audience. 
His art (and long-form writing) is an unflinching exploration on the state of the human condition, delivered with a wit and candor that is as engaging as it is confronting. 
Don't miss his take on rememes of class 6529 cards! 
Each of his creations is an invitation to explore not just an image but a story—a story that questions, critiques, and often mocks the very essence of what it means to exist in a world oversaturated with information yet starving for meaning. 
For collectors, Wilson's work is more than an aesthetic choice; it's a statement, a rebel's megaphone, and a stair-step on the artist's relentless quest to document the madness of the times we live in.
        
Prepare yourself for the madness of Card 167, hitting you in the eyeballs on Nov 17th, 2023!

Embarking on a journey through the digital landscapes crafted by @liboar is an invitation into a world where the boundaries of time, culture, and reality blur into a vivid tapestry of color and imagination. 
Known for a distinctive style that marries chromatic depth with a reverence for artistic heritage, Li's creations are in tension between historic artistic movements and the limitless possibilities of digital expression and gamelike worlds. 
The works are intricate collages of references, blending elements of surrealism, impossible architecture, and narrative art into a unique digital vernacular.

Thematically, Li Boar (a Transylvanian), navigates the realms of myth, literature, and existential musing with a fearless and playful hand. 
The canvases become arenas where historical motifs, literary references, and personal tributes coalesce into intricate stories. 
Whether it's reimagining the works of Giger or paying homage to weird fiction, Li's art is a portal to realms that are at once eerily familiar and startlingly novel. 
Collectors are not merely acquiring a piece of digital art; they are inheriting a segment of a broader narrative that the artist weaves across his oeuvre.
        
Li presents an opportunity to engage with art that is both a visual spectacle and a cerebral exploration. 
The style is immediately recognizable, characterized by its isometric perspectives, lush color palettes, and a harmony of forms that challenge conventional perception. 
The themes often tread the line between the macabre and the fantastical, the real and the surreal, inviting a contemplation that is as much about the internal world of the viewer as it is about the external vision of the artist. 

On Nov 20th, 2023 we get to see what imaginative worlds Li will bring to The Memes in Card 168!

Dutchtide emerges as a distinctive voice in the digital art landscape, crafting pieces that resonate with the quiet introspection of urban solitude and the complex interplay between man-made and natural environments. 
His works, especially evident in series like "Midnight Breeze," often feature architectural structures — from lone apartment blocks to neon-lit convenience stores — set against the backdrop of nature or the stark vastness of the night. 
The contrasting elements of his compositions are not just visual but thematic, delving into philosophical musings on capitalism, wealth, and the environment, all while engaging with the digital medium's inherent properties and possibilities.

Stylistically, Dutchtide's art is marked by a harmonious blend of Japanese and Dutch aesthetics, a synthesis inspired by his deep appreciation for the organizational frameworks of Japanese art and the compositional mastery characteristic of the Dutch Golden Age.
The pixel art technique he employs imbues his works with a nostalgic digital quality, reminiscent of early video game aesthetics, yet the themes he explores are contemporary — isolation in urbanity, the search for true luxury, and the meaning of home in the digital age. 
His choice of this medium is deliberate, aligning with the NFT space's spirit and its community of collectors seeking authenticity and connection.
        
For new collectors, Dutchtide offers more than digital ownership; his artworks are invitations to contemplative journeys through spaces that feel both alien and intimately familiar. 
You are invited into a narrative tableau, encouraging personal reflection on the spaces we inhabit and how they shape our experiences. 
As NFTs continue to blur the lines between art and audience, Dutchtide's creations stand out for their ability to evoke emotion and provoke thought, promising a rich and engaging experience for those who choose to immerse themselves in his digital realms.

Rocketgirl is a multidisciplinary artist hailing from Scotland, whose creative endeavors have carved a space in the world of NFT art that is very much her own. 
With a traditional background in painting, primarily using oils and inks, she has embraced the digital revolution, integrating AI into her art to transcend the conventional boundaries of the medium. 
Her journey into AI art began out of a serendipitous encounter with illness, where, too weak to stand at her easel, she channeled the dystopian visions of her fever dreams into her first AI-assisted piece, "SUNDAY BEST / FALSE IDOLS," which garnered acclaim by winning second prize in an art contest. 
This fusion of AI and traditional artistry is a hallmark of her work, which she describes as "pure, unadulterated chaos" and a "mixed-media chaos engine," indicating a process as spontaneous and unpredictable as the outcomes are compelling.

In her own words, Rocketgirl's drive to create is fueled by "a 100% selfish desire to live on through my work," highlighting a pursuit of immortality through art that echoes the sentiments of many artists before her. 
The thematic essence of her work often revolves around abstract chaos and dark dystopia, capturing the intensity and complexity of human emotions against the backdrop of a world in flux. 
Her artwork, characterized by bold strokes and a vibrant palette, invites viewers into a realm where the traditional and the digital converge, creating a visual language that speaks to the chaos of the modern world.
        
Rocketgirl's vision as an artist is as clear-cut as her stylistic approach is fluid. 
She envisions AI art becoming as uncontroversial as photography, a tool for future generations to express their own dystopian dreams or utopian ideals. 
With a keen eye on the horizon, she aims to be "a renowned and mildly notorious artist with a style that is unforgettable," leaving a legacy that challenges and inspires. 
Her work is not just a reflection of her innermost visions but also a dialogue with the ever-evolving digital landscape, an exploration of how humanity interacts with the increasingly blurred lines between the organic and the artificial.

      info: `
Rare Scrilla, also known as DJ J-Scrilla, is an artist deeply entrenched in the digital revolution of art and music, often exploring the thematic intersections between technology, economics, and culture.
Through his work, he comments on the fluid nature of value in the digital age, epitomized by his track "Faith In My Money (Money Printer Go Brrr)," which wryly observes the effects of economic policies on personal wealth and the surreal nature of fiat currency's value in a world at the mercy of the money printer.

Artistically, Scrilla's style is a blend of the vibrant, often chaotic ethos of internet meme culture and the gritty, street-wise aesthetics of hip hop.
His visual art, particularly his tokenized "Rare Pepe" NFTs, showcases a collage of cultural references (including all 4 elements of hip hop), utilizing the iconic Pepe meme to satirize and celebrate various aspects of urban and crypto culture.
The use of recognizable characters, bold text, and mixed media elements gives his artwork a distinctive, irreverent energy that is immediately fun, memetic, and thought-provoking.

In the realm of audio, Scrilla's style is similarly boundary-pushing, with Ordinal drops.
His foray into audio NFTs demonstrates his innovative spirit, merging his skills as a hip hop music producer with his savvy in crypto-art to create unique, collectible pieces of music.
These audio NFTs carry the thematic weight of his visual art, often containing samples and soundscapes that reflect on the economic and social themes he's known for, while also providing a new avenue for musical expression and artist-audience interaction in the digital space.

Will card 177 boost The Memes with some street savvy on Dec 8th, 2023? We can only hope!

      info: `
Nude Yoga Girl is an enigmatic figure in the digital art world, an anon photographer and artist whose work presents the human body via a lens of natural beauty and powerful stillness. 
In a society where the naked form is often subjected to censorship and sexualization, her art stands as a silent yet potent rebellion. 
Her black and white portraits, which marry the form and fluidity of yoga with the vulnerability of nudity, transcend mere aesthetics to become a statement of liberation.
She seeks the freedom to express the human form gloriously, advocating for a world where the line between art and stigma is redefined, allowing for a celebration of the body in its most honest state.

Her artistic message is clear: to normalize the natural body and promote self-love and acceptance through the intersection two deeply personal disciplines—yoga and photography.
Nude Yoga Girl's photoshoots are introspective explorations, self-portraits that use light, shadow, and composition to tell stories of empowerment and grace.
The strength of her work lies not only in its visual impact but also in its ability to connect with the viewer on an intimate level, challenging them to confront their own perceptions of nudity and self-acceptance.
In the face of social/media censorship, her art becomes an oasis for those needing a reminder that their bodies are worthy of uplifting appreciation, not cloaked judgment.
      
Nude Yoga Girl's artistic strengths lie in her profound understanding of the body's expressive potential and her skillful manipulation of visual elements to amplify her message.
Each photograph is a meticulous orchestration of balance, form, and meaning, often requiring physical rigor and precise timing to capture the ephemeral interplay of the human silhouette against a backdrop of serene landscapes or stark minimalism.
Her anonymity further intensifies the focus on her artistic vision, granting her the freedom to express without the constraints of personal identity, and inviting viewers to project their own narratives onto her work.
This anonymity, paired with her advocacy for unshackled artistic expression, positions Nude Yoga Girl as a compelling voice in the dialogue on freedom, censorship, and the inherent beauty of the human form.

The medium is so clearly the message in her art, and maybe even in Card 186... to be fully revealed on Jan 12th, 2024!`,

Hasan Göktepe stands at the technically-advanced edge of digital art, blending his background in computer engineering with an innate flair for visual storytelling.
His work delves often into the realm of voxel art, where each 'volumetric pixel' or 'voxel' serves as a building block to construct intricate 3D environments and characters, as in "Parking Problems" highlighted here (see details included).
Göktepe's artistry transforms these cubic elements into stunningly detailed and vibrant worlds, brimming with a unique blend of futurism and palpable vitality.
His pieces, while seemingly nostalgic with their blocky textures reminiscent of building with Lego, and early video game aesthetics, push the envelope in digital craftsmanship and thematic exploration.

Louis Dazy's artistry is marked by an adept fusion of light work and portraiture, where neon lights are not mere accents but conduits of mood and character.
He paints his digital canvases so often with the glow of artificial lights, which bathe his subjects in hues that evoke complex emotional landscapes.
His portraits transcend simple depictions of people; they are explorations of moments, often suspended in a palette of nocturnal colors that suggest introspection and a subtle melange of solitude and serenity.

Dazy's thematic messages are conveyed through the interplay of light and environment, with a pronounced use of contrasting colors and shadows that seem to reach beyond the visual to the experiential.
His art often features urban landscapes and motifs that act as silent narrators to the solitary figures within them.
The recurring theme of isolation amidst an electrified world is palpable, with neon signs serving as symbols of modern life's pervasive glow, yet hinting at the underlying disconnect of contemporary existence.
      
The stylistic consistency of Dazy's work—its deliberate pacing, the careful choreography of illuminated and obscured features—creates a distinct atmosphere that resonates with his collectors.
His images are cinematic in the balance of warmth against the cool backdrop of the night, a dance of intimacy and distance.
This stylistic choice reflects a love for the visual language of 1960's film special effects, a nod to the era's mastery of light and shadow, and a testament to Dazy's commitment to the timeless art of storytelling through imagery.

"Be brave in your decisions. The real barriers are in your head only." [*](https://x.com/isayev_art/status/1755273913880166509?s=20)

Orkhan Isayev's artistry resides in the creation of futuristic realms where the boundaries of unlived futures blend seamlessly.
His pieces are not simple illustrations; they are architectural symphonies composed with a digital brush, where each line is a note and the urban landscapes form the melody.
His distinctive use of retrofuturism goes beyond mere aesthetic; it is a narrative device that tells stories of grandiosity rooted in the echoes of Art Deco and whispers of cyberpunk, all while firmly grasping the viewer's reality with familiar urban landmarks.
This juxtaposition invites the viewer to a dance of epochs, a visual dialogue between the nostalgic past and the envisioned future.

His mastery lies in the bold decisions of his color palette and the precision of his lines, which come together in a courageous display that defies the "real barriers" in one's mind, as he suggests. 
Isayev's advice to "be brave in your decisions" is not just a mantra for personal growth but is vividly reflected in his compositions.
Each artwork is a decision, a brave stroke that captures the enormity of cityscapes with an almost cartographic obsession for detail, telling us that every window, every shadow cast, is a story waiting to be told, a dream resisting the theft by doubt.

Navigating through Isayev's work, one feels the undercurrent of his belief that although "doubt is a natural part of life," it should not become a permanent residency.
His creations are a testament to pushing beyond the initial hesitation, reaching for a dream that could easily slip away if one dwells too long in the valleys of uncertainty.
The vibrancy of his worlds—saturated with future-past lore and bustling with the potential of what could be—reminds us that dreams are the blueprints of reality, and it is through the unwavering pursuit of these dreams that true artistry is born.

Roberta Railaitė's artwork is a terror-drenched journey into the shadows of the human psyche, a place where the stark interplay of light and darkness crafts scenes brimming with existential dread and poignant beauty.
Her distinctive artistic style is immediately recognizable, characterized by a limited yet bold color palette that leans heavily on reds, blues, black, and white.
Railaitė's mastery of shade and contrast forms the backbone of her visuals, creating cinematic tableaus that resonate with the eerie stillness of film-noir settings.
These are compositions that speak in near-audible whispers and flickering shadows, where the source of light—be it a single bulb or the glow of a phone screen—acts as a beacon, drawing the viewer's eye and underscoring the isolation and deadly distraction within each piece.

Thematically, Railaitė's work plunges into the depths of 'existential horror,' a term she coins that perfectly encapsulates the evocative nature of her illustrations.
Her pieces are a querying of the innermost feelings of anxiety, loneliness, and an insatiable yearning for understanding and connection.
The figures in her art, often shrouded in darkness or distorted by their environment, mirror the complexity of human emotions and the struggle against the intangible fears that haunt us.
The presence of spectral figures and looming visages in her work suggests an omnipresent watchfulness, evoking the sensation that our inner turmoils and demons are as tangible and inescabable as the characters depicted within these haunting scenes.

Railaitė's illustrations do more than just depict a moment; they are an exploration of the space between reality and the surreal, the external world and the internal landscape of the self.
Her use of stark, isolating environments and ethereal, ghostly figures invites the viewer to confront the darker corners of their own minds.
Railaitė's art is a testament to the power of digital illustration to not only capture the imagination but also to provoke a deeper, introspective examination of the human condition.

BOUBOY, a digital artist from Thailand, is swiftly defining his footprint in the digital art realm with a distinctive collage style that bridges traditional printmaking with an array of digital techniques.
His works are characterized by their bold commentary on socio-political themes, often layered with a sense of urgency and a surreal, graphic aesthetic that beckons viewers to look closer and explore.
The promise to provide art prints to collectors for many works illustrates BOUBOY's commitment to tangible art in an increasingly digital landscape.

Let's take a look at some of his existing work...

The artist's creations, such as the "STOP THE WAR" piece, evoke a powerful response through the juxtaposition of warlike imagery with surreal and symbolic elements.
This particular artwork employs a rich tapestry of textures and motifs that resonates with our universal desire for peace, revealing the far-reaching impacts of conflict.
      
Another artwork depicts a dystopian take on the innocent game of musical chairs, utilizing nude figures and oversized records to critique the competitive nature of society and the scramble for resources.
This piece, alongside the striking visual of a smiley face engulfed in concentric circles, highlights BOUBOY's use of familiar imagery to create new, thought-provoking contexts.
Through these compelling visuals, BOUBOY invites us into a world where traditional forms are reborn with digital vibrancy, inviting meme enjoyoors to explore a new take on memetic themes.
            
We can't wait to see what new takes are revealed in Card 208 on Mar 6th, 2024.`,

Fawkes emerges as a digital virtuoso, crafting vivid realms where the pulse of cyberpunk beats at the heart of every creation.
With a keen eye for the retro-futuristic aesthetic that defined the '80s and '90s, Fawkes' art is a neon-drenched odyssey into worlds where technology and humanity collide in a symphony of pixels and possibilities.
The pieces often exude a narrative strength, suggesting stories begging to be told within their meticulously arranged compositions.
These digital canvases beckon viewers into viewing depths, echoing the artist's reverence for the cyberpunk ethos and its continuous dialogue with the evolution of Web3 technology.

Delving into the visual lexicon of Fawkes' work, one encounters a cross-pollination of inspirations, from the fluorescent glow of classic anime spaceships to the dusky corners of cybernetic control rooms where the future is incessantly monitored and rerouted.
The artist's work is a testament to the power of digital tools in sculpting not just images, but gateways to alternative realities.
This is where nostalgia is reimagined: the familiar is reborn through a kaleidoscope of vibrant colors and intricate designs that pay homage to the days of early computing and the boundless frontiers of the internet age.

Fawkes' art, however, transcends mere aesthetic allure; it becomes a canvas of inquiry.
It urges the onlooker to ponder the symbiotic relationship between technology and individuality within the digital age.
The playful yet poignant use of language, interspersed with technological symbols and motifs, cultivates a dialogue that spans cultures and languages.
Fawkes' portfolio not only captures the imagination but also sparks a conversation about the direction in which our global, interconnected societies might be headed, all the while preserving a sense of wonder for the digital landscapes that could lie ahead.
