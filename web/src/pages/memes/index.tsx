            <h4>Another NFT collection?</h4>
            <p>
              Hardly.
              "The Memes by 6529" is a digital insurgency, an array of meme-themed NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, devised by the world's most prominent collectooor Punk6529, and the multi-disciplinary artist, 6529er.
              The collection is not just about immortalizing memes in the digital realm; it's about leading the charge in advocating for a decentralized open metaverse (OM).
            </p>
            <p>
              The collection is an assembly of ERC-1155 tokens minted on a standalone Manifold contract, with the art preserved in the globally-distrubted vault of Arweave.
              The collection comprises collaborations with numerous esteemed artists, photographers, and 3D designers, highlighting diversity and versatility of creative expression.
            </p>
            <p>
              But "The Memes by 6529" is more than an art project...
              It's a movement.
              To build up a self-sovereign, decentralized metaverse community, the collection is designed for eventual mass adoption. It's ongoing seasons, edition sizes, and price make it accessible, to ensure many people can pick up a piece as one way to aid in spreading awareness and ownership of the open metaverse ideals.

            <h4>Does "art" help create an Open Metaverse?</h4>
            <p>
              "The Memes by 6529" is not just a collection; it's a call to action.
              The mission? Amplify the urgency for a decentralized open metaverse - the OM.
              By immortalizing memes on the Ethereum blockchain, Punk6529 and team are offering a shared cultural experience as broad and diverse as the internet itself.
              This mirrors the vision for the open metaverse, a digital space that is owned and operated by the people who inhabit it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The very nature of the collection – its decentralization, its accessibility, and its community focus – reflects the principles of the open metaverse.
              In a world where digital power has consolidated to major corporations, "The Memes by 6529" offers a vision of a different future: one where power is in the hands of the many, not the few.

                When it's minted, it's released into the public domain.
                That means you can use it for your own projects, and even mint your own NFTs with the art or derivative works.
                Permission granted: you don't need to ask.

            <h4>The Prememes</h4>
            <p>
              Before new meme cards are minted, the artists are announced on Twitter.
              In that magical time between the announcement and the minting, we can only guess what artist wonders the artist's vision will bring.
              That guess is a PREMEME: an introduction to the artist's style, paired with notes on their background and some highlights of their previous work.
            </p>
            <p>
              The prememe is a way to get to know the artist, and to get share our excitement about the upcoming mint.
