I was confused, everything works properly as far as I see. I have reinstalled several times I think I'm at 8 now, tried multiple ways to fix it, including going into the command line. This morning as lecture was happening I did the restart again to get to the desktop and then I noticed when it goes to black screen I can hit any button and it will load into Ubuntu.
